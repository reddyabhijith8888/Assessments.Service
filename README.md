- The Application implemented with an inspiration of Test Driven Development with microservices and multi layer architecture.
- The Domain layer Assessments.Application.Core possesses the domain entities needed by the application.
- Service layer Assessments.Service is the key where all the functions are called and the logic is being served
- Testing layer has different use cases embedded and and tests different components of the application main focus of TDD should be testing the right logics
rather than 100% coverage


# TODO
- Implement Exception Middleware to handle any kind of handled and unhandled exceptions in the application
- Implement some concrete logging techniques
